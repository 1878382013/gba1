PocketSprite TileGFX tile renderer
----------------------------------

The PocketSprite SDK comes with a powerful tile rendered. This tile rendered is capable of rapidly 
rendering maps of 8x8 graphics tiles to the screen, including effects like transparency and fading.
The SDK has integration with the files generated by `Tiled <http://www.mapeditor.org/>`_, a powerful
and  open-source tilemap editor, allowing the tilemaps generated in that program to be embedded in and
rendered from PocketSprite applications.

(ToDo: Describe workflow from tiled to a tilegfx render call)

(ToDo: Describe limitations of the Tiled reader/renderer)

(ToDo: Describe requirements for compiling the tiled map reader... or do that in a separate installation doc?)
